# COMP1110 Homework

These homework exercises are designed to help you learn.
You may do them at your own pace.
The exercises are not marked, but you are welcome to ask your tutor for help during your scheduled lab sessions.

The exercises form the basis for the lab exam, composed of questions randomly drawn from the homework set.

### Running tests

To run the tests for a particular unit (such as J01), select the unit from the drop-down menu next to the small green **Run** arrow at the upper right of your IntelliJ window.

### Updating

We may announce updates to the homework exercises during the semester, in which case, you should do an 'upstream pull' (explained in [lab 2](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp1110/comp1110-labs/blob/master/src/comp1110/lab2/README.md#gitlab-pull-upstream-commits)) on this repo.
